In this lab I created a software for the world's smallest bank. This bank can have only one
customer. The customer will have a checking account and a savings account. The account types have
some specific rules:
Checking Accounts:
- Allows unlimited deposits and withdrawals for free.
- Provides no interest payments.
- If the account balance ever drops below $0, the customer is charged a $20 overdraft fee.
Saving Accounts:
- Must maintain a $500 balance at all times, otherwise the customer is charged $10 each time they
make a withdrawal that lowers their balance below $500.
- Earns 1.5% interest every year
- The first 5 deposits are free, after that there is a fee of $10 per deposit.
